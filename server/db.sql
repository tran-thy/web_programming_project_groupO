    'To make the dumpling wrapper, combine the wheat starch and tapioca flour in a mixing bowl. Gradually add the boiling water to the flour mixture, stirring constantly, until a dough forms. Knead the dough until smooth and elastic. Cover with a damp cloth and let it rest for 20-30 minutes. While the dough is resting, prepare the filling. In a separate bowl, mix together the chopped shrimp, bamboo shoots, soy sauce, sesame oil, sugar, and white pepper. Divide the dough into small pieces and roll each piece into a ball. Keep the dough covered with a damp cloth to prevent it from drying out. On a lightly floured surface, flatten each dough ball into a thin circle, about 3 inches in diameter. Place a spoonful of filling in the center of each dough circle. Fold the edges of the dough over the filling and pinch to seal, forming a pleated edge. Repeat with the remaining dough and filling. Steam the dumplings in a bamboo steamer lined with parchment paper or cabbage leaves, for 8-10 minutes, or until the filling is cooked through and the wrapper is translucent. Serve the crystal dumplings hot with soy sauce or your favorite dipping sauce.'
