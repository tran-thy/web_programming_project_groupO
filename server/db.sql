The name ""b√°nh x√®o"" comes from the sound it makes when poured onto the pan. When the batter is poured into hot oil, it sizzles and continues to sizzle until the pancake is nearly cooked.

    'Bo Bia is a Vietnamese spring roll filled with jicama, carrots, Chinese sausage, egg, and dried shrimp, wrapped in rice paper and served with a sweet and savory dipping sauce. A beloved street food snack in Vietnam.',
    '"B√≤ b√≠a" (Hokkien: p»Øh-pi√°‚Åø, ËñÑÁöÆÂç∑, in Sino-Vietnamese is "B·∫°c b√≠nh," meaning "thin pastry roll") is a dish originating from the culinary styles of Chaozhou (Teochew) and Fujian, China, now popular in Taiwan, Singapore, and Malaysia. In Fujian, it is often consumed in Haixi, while in Chaozhou, it is a common dish in the Chaozhou region in the east of the province during Qingming Festival. In Vietnam, this dish may have been introduced by Chaozhou immigrants or Peranakan people (also known as Baba Nyonya or simply Baba).
    Traditional-style "b√≤ b√≠a" is rare in Vietnam nowadays. The original type of rice paper used for wrapping traditional Fujian-style "b√≤ b√≠a" is a smooth rice paper made from wheat flour (which housewives often use for wrapping spring rolls). The ingredients of "b√≤ b√≠a" rolls are very diverse: lettuce, bean sprouts, eggs, shrimp, dried shrimp, peanuts, chili sauce, black bean sauce alongside the main ingredient of a mixture of jicama and carrot. The original "b√≤ b√≠a" rolls are quite large, three times larger than those in Saigon. Therefore, vendors often cut them into multiple portions for easier consumption.
    In Saigon, savory "b√≤ b√≠a" is made with ingredients such as Chinese sausage, thinly sliced ‚Äã‚Äãboiled eggs, carrots, lettuce, jicama, or turnips, dried shrimp, herbs... all finely chopped and rolled in wheat flour rice paper. The condiments served alongside include black bean sauce with peanuts, fried shallots, and ground chili. The use of wheat flour rice paper instead of smooth rice paper for wrapping "b√≤ b√≠a" in the South can also be explained by the abundant local rice reserves. The Chinese used it to replace wheat flour in smooth rice paper, which in turn changed the way "b√≤ b√≠a" is wrapped.',

	The ""version"" of sour soup in the northern style often includes some regional specialty fruits such as starfruit, gourd, or sour tamarind. Particularly, housewives never add sugar to the soup to preserve the natural taste of the ingredients. Meanwhile, in the western and southern regions, sour soup always combines a rich sweetness from sugar, accompanied by spicy chili peppers.

    'Mi Quang (Vietnamese Noodle with Pork and Shrimp)',
	'Mi Quang is a Vietnamese noodle dish originating from the central region of Vietnam. It features wide rice noodles, pork, shrimp, and a flavorful broth made with turmeric and aromatics.',
	'"M√¨ Qu·∫£ng" from Quang Nam is nearly the first dish that comes to mind when speaking of the culinary characteristics of the Quang Nam - Da Nang region. Although this dish can be found scattered throughout other provinces and cities of the country, it is only when eaten in Quang Nam that one fully appreciates its rich flavor.

	"M√¨ Qu·∫£ng" appears to be a unique creation of the Quang Nam region, not based on any existing tradition. Firstly, regarding its name, the term ""m√¨"" (noodles) seems inappropriate but is quite distinctive. Noodles are originally a product of the Chinese, made from wheat flour. Traditional Vietnamese dishes did not include any dishes called ""m√¨"" (except for ""m√¨ Qu·∫£ng,"" of course). ""M√¨ Qu·∫£ng"" is the only noodle dish in Vietnam, but ironically, it merely borrows the name; in reality, those strands are made from rice flour, without any trace of wheat flour. Its uniqueness lies in this aspect. Not relying on any tradition, even the naming convention is novel. ""M√¨ Qu·∫£ng"" deserves to be a subject of cultural research in the history of the Central region.
	Currently, ""m√¨ Qu·∫£ng"" offers various versions like snakehead fish, chicken, shrimp, and meat, with the latest being frog. Though not complex to cook, it requires meticulous ingredient preparation. A bowl of ""m√¨ Qu·∫£ng"" boasts colorful natural ingredients, flavorful broth, 9-flavor raw vegetables, sesame rice crackers, peanuts, and more. Its vibrant yellow noodles pair perfectly with green chilies, offering a rich and spicy flavor. Accompanied by black sesame rice crackers and raw vegetables, it epitomizes Central Vietnamese cuisine.',
